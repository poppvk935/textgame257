Down the long hallway, better lit than anything else you've seen around here, you can see a staircase. Unfortunately, unless you want tetanus, braving the southward walk of old rusty weapons and broken weapons stands doesn't sound like a good idea.

hall4
The hallway looks much like the others you've been in. This whole place looks concerningly easy to get lost in. To the north, the hallway with the weird rubble. To the west, a twisting, abnormally dark hallway. To the right, an ornate door closed off with heavy objects, as if to keep everything out no matter what.

#
hall5_B
The horseshoe shaped hallway feels much more cold than the rest of the dungeon. You have a sinking feeling you're being watched out of the small bar windows in the nearly pitch black cells behind you. At the dead end of the horseshoe, traveling north is a cell with a fragile door.

You can look in the small hole for a window and see something on the floor
