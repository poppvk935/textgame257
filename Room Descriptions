startCell
The room where you woke up. To your east, the cell door. The door's lock appears to have been broken, allowing you easy access to and from. 
#
hall1
You are in a dimly lit hallway. Its low ceilings and narrow walls make you claustrophobic. To the west is the cell you woke up in. To the east, another, equally narrow hallway extends into darkness. To the south, a large open corridor. Next to your cell, a stairway leads upstairs. 
#
stairwell
You are in the old stairwell. The small stairs and narrow hallway of this spiraling mess make your head spin. At the top of the stairwell, a heavy locked stone door sits. You wonder if this is the exit.  
#
openCor
You are in a large open corridor. In comparison to the halls around it, this room is a breath of fresh air. It is well lit. 
To the west leads to the bathroom. The north leads into a narrow corridor. You can kind of see where you started from it. Up a few stairs you can see a door.

muckyBath
You are in a mucky old bathroom, overtaken by mold. Your head spins at the muggy moldy scent that permeates the room. The small room contains

You are in the unlocked cell

hall3
Down the long hallway, better lit than anything else you've seen around here, you can see a staircase. Unfortunately, unless you want tetanus, braving the southward walk of old rusty weapons and broken weapons stands doesn't sound like a good idea. 
#
stairC
 The entrance to the stairway is blocked by weapons and rubble. You don't want to go over there. 
#
stairC_unlocked
The stairway leads upstairs to a brightly lit room. Back downstairs is the hallway full of rusty metal.
#
hall4
The hallway looks much like the others you've been in. This whole place looks concerningly easy to get lost in. To the north, the hallway with the weird rubble. To the west, a twisting, abnormally dark hallway. To the right, an ornate door closed off with heavy objects, as if to keep everything out no matter what. 
#
hall5
Looking down the hallway, you can make out that it turns, but not much more than that. You get a weird feeling from this hallway. Probably shouldn't go down there. 
#
hall5_B
The horseshoe shaped hallway feels much more cold than the rest of the dungeon. You have a sinking feeling you're being watched out of the small bar windows in the nearly pitch black cells behind you. At the dead end of the horseshoe, traveling north is a cell with a fragile door.

cell3
You can look in the small hole for a window and see something on the floor
